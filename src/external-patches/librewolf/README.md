# Patches imported from LibreWolf

Firefox sometimes makes changes without considering the impact on forks. This is the case of the patches that are imported from LibreWolf, which are already present in LibreWolf but not yet (or never) present in Firefox. Thanks to LibreWolf for making these patches available and for their work in maintaining them. We will keep these patches as long as they are needed, and we will remove them once they are no longer necessary (for example, when they are merged into Firefox or when the issue they solve is no longer present).
